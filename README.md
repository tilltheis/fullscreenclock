# Fullscreen Clock
Display a clock on all of your inactive screens when running an application in fullscreen mode.

# Usage
Put fullscreenclock.app into your login items (System Preferences/Accounts/<user name>/Login Items) to automatically start it when you startup your computer. You're set and all you have to do now is to startup a fullscreen capable application

# Compatibilty
Sadly, not all applications are currently supportet (eg. Counter-Strike Source) but you can double-click fullscreenclock.app and you get a preference window where you can show the clocks manually. You when you are done working or playing you can hide the clocks in the same way.

# Appearance
You can change the appearance settings by double-clicking fullscreenclock.app when it's already running.
